Our review of key digital marketing strategies (key words bidding & selection, defining target customer / location etc.) showed the following: Define upper bid limit for buying ‘keyword’: Upper bid limit should be defined by the agency while bidding for a keyword over Google & Facebook platforms. Keyword has a real-time dynamic pricing over Google and Facebook. In absence of defined upper bid limit, budgets may get exhausted with few clicks / reach resulting in high cost per click (CPC). Due to real time dynamic pricing, platforms provide option to select various bidding strategies like highest bid, lowest bid, maximum cost per click (CPC), maximize reach etc. Annexure 1 Usage of product name based keyword (~ INR 34 lakhs): Consider selection of product based keywords for Google Ad campaigns in addition to the current practice of selecting keyword on the basis of brand name (like “SPAR India” or “SPAR online”). Also, the process / strategy adopted by agency for selection of keywords should be revisited by Marketing team. Cost to income ratio achieved during Jan – June 2019 was only ~ 8%. Our independent review of competitors’ website traffic details for January to June 2019 showed that majority of the traffic was reached through product based search by consumers (rather than by brand name). Annexure 2 We also noted that certain keywords selected by the agency were combination of product name and feature. Instances are given in Exhibit 1 Location specific campaign (~ INR 4.5 lakhs during Oct-18 to Jun-19): Marketing should explore the possibility of launching location specific engagement campaigns for better results and higher visibility in localities with store presence. At present, digital campaigns are launched across India without defining any specific target locations. Annexure 3 Conduct local SEO optimization: Enhance local SEO experience of customers by correctly mapping all store locations, uploading high quality store images and timely responding to customer reviews. This will also help in collecting information from ‘Google My Business’ regarding number of store searches, website visits and calls dialed on store numbers. Explore available Ad strategies: Explore the possibility of launching digital campaigns based on Product List Ads (PLA) and Dynamic Product Ads (DPA). As per industry benchmarks, image based campaigns generate higher reach / clicks compared to text based Ads. Annexure 4 DPA Ads display multiple products to customers and are ideally adopted during stock clearance sales or discounting for near-to expiry stocks.
